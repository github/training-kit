## Using GitHub Issues

GitHub issues are used to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

- Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team (even your future team member) has the complete story.
- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation with @ mentions and team mentions.

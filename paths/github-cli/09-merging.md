  ## Why No Collaboration?

  1. :white_check_mark: Create a branch
  1. :white_check_mark: Add commits
  1. :white_check_mark: Open a Pull Request
  1. **Collaborate, and make more commits** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_
  1. **Merge the Pull Request** :arrow_left: _(This section deals with this step.)_

  A Pull Request is typically an opportunity for code review and collaboration. In this class, you are creating a personal web site, so you can bypass that step. However, if you'd like anyone to collaborate on your open Pull Request, it's as simple as at-mentioning them.

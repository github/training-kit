  Crazy thought, but true; If you're reading this, you're in a position to make changes that can impact the entire world.

  **You**: _But what if I can't code?! :sob:_

  That's fine. :smile: This course doesn't expect you to know any language other than English.

  **You**: _Why should I spend the time? What's at the end of all this?_

  Think of this course as the instruction book for opening doors to any computerized field that you'd like to learn more about or contribute to (when you're ready - no rush).

  Some cool things that are Open Sourced (and on GitHub):

  - Life saving medical software
  - The United States Federal Source Code policy
  - Programming languages that the Internet is built on
  - Books and Tutorials

  By the end, you'll know how to:

  - Find Open Source projects that you care about
  - Critically understand those projects and their responsiveness
  - Contribute to projects (whether this is code or something else)
  - Get involved in communities

  ### The Butterfly Effect

  Fun fact, Wikipedia also thrives and benefits from the principles of Open Source. In that spirit, I'll link you to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect), which details the Butterfly Effect.  

  **TL;DR**
  >The butterfly effect is the concept that small causes can have large effects. Initially, it was used with weather prediction but later the term became a metaphor used in and out of science.

  This is where you'll find deeper (or tangential) explanations about stuff. If you like to know things, click here. Live dreams.

  **TL;DR:** Your journey might start with the smallest, most inconsequential commits, Pull Requests, and experiences. No matter how small the effect seems, the impact that it has potential to extend to is tremendous.

  To illustrate: A story about Bryan.

  Bryan started coding about a year ago. Before that, he didn't know a thing about programming.  Despite this, in his first weeks of learning, part of his weekly ritual was to scour GitHub to seek out some simple issues to contribute to. One day (probably a month or so after he started this ritual), he reached out to all of his friends, bursting with pride, because he had a Pull Request successfully merged into a repository.

  Even better? That repository belongs to Google.

  What did he do?

  The smallest thing! He updated the license to one of _hundreds_ of components that made up one of Google's (at the time) new programming languages.

  That's it! But you know what? Bryan can now say that he is a contributor to Google. Also, this is actually a true story. He's a real person with a real commit to Google, and now works for Uber.

  And even though his change isn't the most inspiring change, the story is what carries. This happened a year ago, and is something that his friends still talk about. And now that story is here, serving as a small inspiration that has the potential to impact anyone who decided to take this course and read this section, before making their own commits and sharing their own stories. 

  **cough** _Butterfly Effect_ **cough**  

  Where do you want your story to start?

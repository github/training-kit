  Before deciding to contribute to a project, you can inspect a couple of elements of the repository to determine if their is active development on it. Using the [Atom](www.github.com/atom) repository as an example, lets review some areas that help determine the health of a repository.

  ![image-center](../images/os_repoexample.png){: .align-center}

  1. Is there a description/link? If so, cool! Is that link something you want to contribute to?
  2. How detailed is the README.md? Is it populated at all? Does it feel welcoming and easy to understand?
  3. How many `issues` are there? What about `pull requests`?
  4. What do the `pulse` and `graphs` tabs look like?
   - Is there recent activity?
  5. How many `stars`, `forks`, and `watch` numbers are there?

  ### You can also use tools to help you with your assessment.

  - [This](http://isitmaintained.com/) link helps you assess the average time it takes to close an issue, and how many issues in total are open.
    - To be fair, this isn't always the best way to assess a repository. Sometimes issues stay open for a long time to indicate that there aren't enough contributors.
  - [This](https://sarahsharp.github.io/foss-heartbeat/) resource helps you assess community involvement within a repository.

  Another incredible checklist from the [Contributing to Open Source Guide](http://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute-to-open-source/#a-checklist-before-you-contribute):

  #### Meets the definition of open source

  - Does it have a license? Usually, this is a file called LICENSE in the root of the repository.

  #### Project actively accepts contributions

  Start by looking at commit activity on the master branch. On GitHub, you can see this information on a repository's homepage.

  - When was the latest commit?
  - How many contributors does the project have?
  - How often do people commit? (On GitHub, you can find this by clicking "Commits" in the top bar.)

  Next, look at the project's issues.

  - How many open issues are there?
  - Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
  - Is there active discussion on the issues?
  - Are the issues recent?
  - Are issues getting closed? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Issues page to see closed issues.)

  Now do the same for the project's pull requests.

  - How many open pull requests are there?
  - Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?
  - Is there active discussion on the pull requests?
  - Are the pull requests recent?
  - How recently were any pull requests merged? (On GitHub, click the "closed" tab on the Pull Requests page to see closed PRs.)

  #### Project is welcoming

  A project that is friendly and welcoming signals that they will be receptive to new contributors.

  - Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?
  - Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (ex. IRC or Slack)?
  - Do pull requests get reviewed?
  - Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?

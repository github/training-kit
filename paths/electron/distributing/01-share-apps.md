  So you have a packaged app, but now what? The next few pages will walk through how to make apps easy to find and download. The Electron team keeps the [source of truth](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/application-distribution.md) for application distribution.

  ### Legal things to be aware of

  Once you're sharing your app, your licenses and other legal things need to be in order. We recommend [choose the right license for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/) early on to avoid headaches in the future.

  ### Getting Help
  
  If you have any issues and need help, we've created a repository for you! If you have any questions throughout this course, go here to open an issue and ask a question: [On Demand Electron App Repo](https://github.com/githubschool/on-demand-electron-app).

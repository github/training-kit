 * The index file we created is just an HTML file. We can add any HTML we wish.
 * Add some basic markup to your index file so that it looks something like this:

        <html>
          <body>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          </body>
        </html>

 * Add, commit and push, just like last time.

        $ git add index.html
        $ git commit -m 'adding some basic HTML formatting'
        $ git push

 * Refresh the page in your web browser and admire your changes.

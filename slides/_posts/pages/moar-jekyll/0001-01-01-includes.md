* Includes allow you to reuse common elements
* Includes live in the `_includes` folder, and can be in any format
* Includes can be dropped into a file using the format <code>&#123;% include [file] %}</code>, where `[file]` is the file you want to include
* To include `_includes/sidebar.html` for example, simply add <code>&#123;% include sidebar.html %}</code> to the layout
* Note includes use the <code>&#123;% ... %}</code> format, while printing template data uses the <code>&#123;{ ... }}</code> format

* Jekyll's most powerful (and simplest) feature is called "layouts"
* A layout is simply a predefined HTML (or anything really) template which helps Jekyll render content more beautifullyer
* Layouts live in the `_layouts` folder (you may have to create this initially)
* When the layout is processed, the keyword <Br /><code>&#123;{ content }}</code> is replaced with the file's content
